HANDOVER — Start here (next team)

What this is
- REST API: create a "protocol execution" (start a protocol at a site). API key auth, Postgres, webhooks for status updates. No real Reportheld backend yet — status changes are simulated.

Run it (~5 min)
- Node 18+, Docker running.
  1. cp .env.example .env
  2. docker compose -f data/docker-compose.yml up -d
  3. npm install && npm start
  4. Open http://localhost:4001

What works
- API key validation, tenant from key, POST creates execution (201), simulated lifecycle (init → in_progress → completed), webhooks to given URL, built-in /webhook-receiver and /webhook-events for testing, test UI at /index.html, Postgres + auto table creation.

What’s missing / not done
- No real Reportheld integration (simulated only). No webhook signing/retry, no "rejected" status, no rate limit, no audit log, no API key management API, no tests.

Where things live
- server.js = entry, routes; db.js = Postgres + init; controllers/ = create execution + webhooks; middleware/ = API key; models/ = SQL; routes/ = mount; public/index.html = test UI; data/docker-compose.yml = Postgres.

Open questions for next team
- How to auth with real Reportheld? Webhook URL per-tenant in DB or per-request? Real status lifecycle (e.g. queued/paused)? GET execution by id or webhook-only? Concurrency/scale expectations?
