IMPROVEMENTS — For next versions

High priority (v2)
- JWT authentication: optional tokens with expiry/refresh; keep API key support for backward compatibility.
- Webhook signing (e.g. HMAC-SHA256) so receivers can verify payloads.
- Webhook retry with exponential backoff; consider a queue or retry table.
- GET /api/v1/protocol-executions/:id so consumers can check status (fallback for missed webhooks, dashboards).
- Rate limiting per API key (e.g. express-rate-limit).
- Request/response or audit logging (e.g. morgan or custom logger).

Medium priority (v2 or v3)
- OpenAPI/Swagger so the API is self-documenting.
- Scopes per API key (e.g. execute:protocols, read:status).
- Webhook URL registration per tenant in the DB instead of per-request.
- Database migrations (e.g. node-pg-migrate) instead of CREATE TABLE in code.
- Automated test suite (e.g. Jest + supertest) for regression safety.

Low priority (v3+)
- Pagination for a list endpoint (e.g. GET executions with cursor).
- GET /health for monitoring and load balancers.
- Simulate "rejected" status for testing failure paths.
- Dockerfile for the API so one docker-compose up runs the full stack.
- MCP layer so AI agents can call the API as a tool.
