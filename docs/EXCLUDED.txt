EXCLUDED FROM V1 — What we didn’t build (on purpose)

Protocol or template create/edit
We only expose "execute a protocol". Creating or editing protocols/templates is internal domain; exposing it would risk data corruption and isn’t needed for automation.

User and group management
Admin-only; high security risk. Belongs in Reportheld’s own UI, not in this API.

Generic CRUD / raw database exposure
The API is a product surface (domain actions), not a mirror of the database. We avoided GET/PUT/DELETE on generic resources to keep boundaries clear and reduce coupling.

GET execution status
Status updates go out via webhooks. We didn’t add a GET-by-id endpoint to avoid encouraging polling; it can be added in v2 as a fallback or for dashboards.

Webhook retry and delivery guarantees
Would need queues, retries, dead-letter handling. Left for v2; prototype is best-effort delivery.

Rate limiting
Not needed for a prototype with a couple of test keys. Important for production; see IMPROVEMENTS.txt.

Automated tests
We relied on manual curl and the test UI. A proper test suite should be added before production.

JWT / token-based auth
Static API keys are enough for the prototype. JWT (expiry, refresh, scopes) is planned for v2.
