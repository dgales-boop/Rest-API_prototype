EXCLUDED FROM V1 — What we didn’t build (on purpose)

- Protocol/template create or edit — internal domain; risky to expose.
- User/group management — admin only; security risk.
- Generic CRUD / raw DB — API is domain actions, not a DB mirror.
- GET execution status — webhooks cover updates; GET can come in v2.
- Webhook retry / delivery guarantees — extra complexity; v2.
- Rate limiting — not needed for prototype; v2.
- Automated tests — manual curl/UI for now; add before production.
- JWT — API keys enough for prototype; JWT in v2.
