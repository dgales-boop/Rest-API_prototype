DOMAIN — What this API does in Reportheld

What Reportheld is
- Manages templates, protocols, inspections, reporting. Most of that is internal; we don’t expose it.

What we expose
- One action: "Start a protocol at a site" → POST /api/v1/protocol-executions
- Good for automation (n8n, scripts). Safe (doesn’t change templates). Status updates go out via webhooks.

Lifecycle (this prototype)
- initialized → in_progress (after 2s) → completed (after 5s). Each step POSTs to the caller’s webhook URL.
- In production, transitions would come from real Reportheld events.

Who uses it
- n8n / automation, future AI agents, future dashboards. Auth: X-API-Key → one tenant per key.

Tenant
- Every API key maps to one tenant. Tenant is read from the key (server-side only), stored on each execution. No cross-tenant access.
